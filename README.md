# dynamic width scroll table

This branch is based off of https://github.com/justinwoo/cycle-scroll-table/ and uses architecture that Andre helped make in that branch using Cycle.js.

Very different from my really simple react-rxjs-flow example, but should be more interesting as a "more complete" example.

Also based off of https://github.com/justinwoo/godforsaken-dynamic-width-scroll-table/
